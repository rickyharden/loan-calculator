# loan-calculator

The Challenge:
The challenge of this test is to create a full web page that contains a loan calculator, which given a loan amount and interest rate it will calculate how long it would take to pay it off and also a breakdown of how much is left of the balance after each month.
You can choose the technology you would like to use for this, NodeJS, AngularJS, Backbone, React, Bootstrap, jQuery, PHP.
You can either upload this to a github account of yours or send us the completed test and all assets back so we can view it locally.


Here are some guidelines we would like to have.

HTML:
Create webpage containing:
Header,
Form,
Image
Link to its own stylesheet,
Link to its own javascript file

The form should contain the following:
input, Loan amount,
input, Payments each month,
input, Interest amount PA. (per annual)


Add an area underneath to print out a table containing 2 columns (Date taken (in Years and Months) and Remaining Balance), this should be initially hidden from view.



CSS:
Style this however you would like although it does need to be responsive for desktops and mobiles, feel free to be creative.



Functionality:
Note: interest should be calculated each month based on the remaining balance after you make a payment. The interest percent is give as an annual figure though not monthly. ( E.G £10,000 paying £200 at 4%, first month will be £9833.33 )

Calculate the amount of years and months it would take to clear the loan. (Remember the interest is provided as per annual).

Print out the balance at each month in the format (0 Years 1 Month - £845, 0 Years 2 Months - £800, etc) into a table.

Now extend the table to include the interest they pay at each stage in brackets after the remaining amount.

Technology:
You can choose how to create this, jQuery, React, NodeJS, Express, PHP. The choice is yours however bonus points are awarded for using new tech where possible.
